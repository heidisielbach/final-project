To view this project, open FinalHS.qmd, copy into R, and render the document. All necessary code is located within the Quarto document. 

Due to isses with committing and pushing, halfway through the project the code was copied into a new quarto document 'FinalHS' from the document I started it in 'final-project-R'. To view the full history of the project and all commits, please examine the commit history of both files.
